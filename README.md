# DTBSR
## Discord Twitch BSR Intergration!

### Why the hell was this made?
I actually made this so i can have my friends be able to send beat saber song requests without them complaining that they have to go to twitch. 

### How does this actually work?
It takes the one command that matters (/request) and sends a message in the twitch chat of YOUR CHOICE and sending the appropate !bsr command. Are there better ways to do this? Absolutly. Am I too lazy to actually do the hard thing to make it nicer? Also yes.

### How do I install it?
Hell if i know. I'll make a tutorial soon. I just wanted to get my code uploaded.
